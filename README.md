- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- View all tasks

### Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Tkinter (for GUI), SQLite (for database)

### How to Run
1. Open the project directory.
2. Run the `todo_list.py` file.
3. The application window will appear, allowing you to manage your tasks.

## Simple Calculator

### Project Description
The Simple Calculator project is a basic arithmetic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. This project helps you understand basic mathematical operations and GUI handling.

### Features
- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Clear the current input
- User-friendly interface

### Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Tkinter (for GUI)

### How to Run
1. Open the project directory.
2. Run the `simple_calculator.py` file.
3. The calculator window will appear, allowing you to perform calculations.

## Rock Paper Scissors Game (GUI)

### Project Description
The Rock Paper Scissors Game is a classic hand game implemented with a graphical user interface. This project introduces you to game development concepts and GUI interactions.

### Features
- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer
- Interactive GUI
- Display game results

### Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Tkinter (for GUI)
- Random (for computer's move generation)
